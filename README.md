This is my quarter one project. It is a game similar to gradius.
[Deployed here](https://tnaicker.github.io/Quarter-One-Project/)

Initially I was trying to create tetris, however while I was experimenting with collision and arcade physics for phaser, I ended up wanting to make a shoot em up style game more.

I had started out wanting to make something similar to the touhou series games, basically vertical style shooter, but I ended up liking the idea of a horizontal scrolling shooter more. So I ended up trying to model my game after Gradius.

This game was made using JQuery, Phaser, and Firebase. Sprites were obtained from opengameart.org
